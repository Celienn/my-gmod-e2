# Introduction
This is a collection of Expression 2 scripts I created and wanted to share.  
To use them, you will need to have both **Garry's Mod** and the **Wiremod** addon installed.

# Holographic Spider
Using the FABRIK inverse kinematics algorithm, I created a fully controllable holographic spider that can climb any surface.

### How to use:
- Wire the E2 to both a **Pod Controller** and a **Camera Controller**.
- Use the **WASD** keys to control the spiderâ€™s movement.
